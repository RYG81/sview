11.05 (2011.05.29)
  Intermidiate experimental version.
  + added support for 8-bit and 32-bit audio formats;
  + added (optional) FreeImage library support;
  + added playback for mk3d files (matroska 3D-stereo) within stereo format flag;
  + read parallax value stored in MPO images by Fujifilm cameras;
  + read EXR and HDR images (using FreeImage and DevIL);
  + added brightness and saturation control;
  + added new experimental plugin - CAD Viewer based on Open CASCADE Technology
    (reading CAD models in formats IGES, STEP, BREP; triangulation in format OBJ);
  * eliminate system windows - use GL widgets to show warnings / errors when applicable;
  * Windows, improved NPAPI plugin stability;
  * images with alpha channel now shown with checkboard background;
  * Linux (Xlib), improved fullscreen switch rootines:
     - task bar was not overlaped in some case;
     - now keyboard input not locked to sView in fullscreen;
  * improved windowed stereo - offscreen frame buffer now trimmed to window dimensions (to avoid image blurring);
  * added mouse wheel control for NVIDIA 3DVision output.

11.03 (2011.03.27)
  First public experimental version.
  * package for Windows now packed with multi-theaded decoding enabled FFmpeg libraries;
  * replace DevIL with FFmpeg for image processing (increase image loading time, use native YUV colorspace for JPEGs);
  * added experimental frame-sequential source stereo format for video player;
  * use GLSL for all planar YUV formats (not only YUV420p as before);
  * detach most GLSL programs from binaries to dedicated files (thus allow others to customize them).

11.02 (2011.02.20)
  + added Green/Magenta anaglyph filter;
  + new menu item to change GUI language;
  + implemented changeable monitors configuration to allow configurations like AMD Eyefinity for advanced user;
  + 64bit version of NPAPI browser plugin now registered in Windows system too (to be used with 64bit Browsers like Firefox 3.6.3 x86_64);
  * NPAPI browser plugin MIME-types list was extended with image/jps, image/pns and image/mpo (improve compatibility with some galleries);
  * small fixes of GUI elements;
  * fixed BUG that may cause significant slowdown of application GUI in some cases (long system inactivity);
  * demo image was updated;
  * fixed multichannel audio playback on the Linux distributives with modern FFmpeg version (Ubuntu 10.10+);
  * fixed errors that may cause OpenGL calls to release video memory when OpenGL context was already destroyed (may cause application crash on some OpenGL-drivers);
  * added more standard paths for standard fonts (Gentoo and Fedora);
  * NPAPI-plugin now registered within DEB-package installation (notice: it is still not totally stable, you may consider to disable it in the browser settings);

10.11 (2010.11.14)
  + added experimental diagnostics module (for stereoscopic displays calibration);
  * fixed left/right reversion for anaglyph and iZ3D outputs;
  * fixed videoplayback issue which may cause wrong FPS and seek problems for some videos;
  * fixed out-of-window mouse unclick problem on Windows;
  * improved compatibility with old GPU hardware without GL_RED texture support (YUV video playback);
  * on Windows systems within only one monitor slave window now hidden (Dual Output and iZ3D output);

10.08 (2010.08.22)
  First official release.

9.05 (2009.05.24)
  First public experimental version based on new code. Changes relative to sView 2008:

  * Internet Browser plugin for embedded stereo (supported NPAPI browsers);
  * Audio/Video playback via FFmpeg and OpenAL libraries;
  * enhanced devices support list, output mode auto-detection mechanism (for some devices);
  * GLSL (OpenGL shader language) and OpenGL2, speed up rendering on modern hardware;
  * mono output support (program now more universal!);
  * spheric panorama output (sphere - 'P' key);
  * better fit to the screen feature;
  * native Unicode support;
  * better multi-monitors configurations support;
  * module architecture, another developers could provide own stereo-devices support extensions;
  * Drag&Drop support;
  * no files count limit;
  * Windows AMD64 builds;
  * language translations now loaded from external text files;
  * new version scheme, Ubuntu-style;
  * better multi-threading support;
  * a lot of user-friendly improvements;
